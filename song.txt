Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hangin' over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday

Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go, I don'tâ€¦

Come together

Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me

Here come old flat top
He come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker
He just do what he please

Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me

He wear no shoeshine
He got toe jam football

He got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is
You got to be free
Come together, right now
Over me

THE END
